Getting Started
Prerequisites
Node.js and npm installed on your machine.

Installation
Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/DPEDITS/Chat-App.git
cd Chat-App

Set up the frontend:
Navigate to the client directory and install the dependencies.

cd client
npm install

Set up the backend:
Navigate to the server directory, install the dependencies, and create a .env file for your environment variables.

cd ../server
npm install

Configure the backend environment variables:
Create a .env file in the server directory and add the following variables, replacing the placeholder values with your own:

MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your_cloudinary_cloud_name
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your_cloudinary_api_key
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your_cloudinary_api_secret

To enable ES module syntax (import ... from ...), make sure your package.json file in the server directory includes the following line:

{
  "type": "module"
}

Running the Application
Start the backend server:
From the server directory, run:

npm run dev

Note: This command assumes your package.json has a dev script that uses nodemon.

Start the frontend development server:
From the client directory, run:

npm run dev

This will start the Vite development server. Open your browser and navigate to the address shown in the terminal (e.g., http://localhost:5173).
